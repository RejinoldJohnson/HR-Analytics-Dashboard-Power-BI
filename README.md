# HR-Analytics-Dashboard-Power-BI

Developed an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard in Power BI using real-life employee attendance data. This project focuses on analyzing employee presence, work-from-home (WFH), and sick leave (SL) trends to provide actionable insights. Key tasks included data transformation, creation of DAX measures, and matrix tables to visualize data efficiently.

Data Transformation & Cleaning: Utilized Power BI's data transformation tools to clean and structure real-life attendance data for accurate analysis of employee presence, WFH, and SL trends.

Advanced DAX Measures: Created custom DAX measures to calculate essential metrics, including Presence %, WFH %, and SL %, providing a clear view of attendance patterns by date and day of the week.

Interactive Visuals & Insights: Built dynamic visuals like line charts and matrices that enable HR teams to monitor attendance trends over time, enhancing data-driven decision-making.
